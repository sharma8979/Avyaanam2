         Our beloved Facebook community is still alive and well. The content from here 
         will also be posted there. However, there are things to explore here that go beyond the page where we started.
         It is time for our community to grow, and get a bigger place to sink its roots.

         <h3 className='text-left text-[20px] mt-6 font-light   px-[22%]'>
             Look around and see all the new things I am planting here for us to enjoy in the months to come.
